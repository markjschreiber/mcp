## Instructions for AI Assistants

This MCP server enables AI assistants to help users with AWS HealthOmics genomic workflow management. Here's how to effectively use these tools:

### Understanding AWS HealthOmics

AWS HealthOmics is designed for genomic data analysis workflows. Key concepts:

- **Workflows**: Computational pipelines written in WDL, CWL, or Nextflow that process genomic data
- **Runs**: Executions of workflows with specific input parameters and data
- **Tasks**: Individual steps within a workflow run
- **Storage Types**: STATIC (fixed storage) or DYNAMIC (auto-scaling storage)

### Workflow Management Best Practices

1. **Creating Workflows**:
   - Use `PackageWorkflow` to bundle workflow files before creating
   - Validate workflows with appropriate language syntax (WDL, CWL, Nextflow)
   - Include parameter templates to guide users on required inputs

2. **Version Management**:
   - Create new versions for workflow updates rather than modifying existing ones
   - Use descriptive version names that indicate changes or improvements
   - List versions to help users choose the appropriate one

### Workflow Execution Guidance

1. **Starting Runs**:
   - Always specify required parameters: workflow_id, role_arn, name, output_uri
   - Choose appropriate storage type (DYNAMIC recommended for most cases)
   - Use meaningful run names for easy identification
   - Configure caching when appropriate to save costs and time

2. **Monitoring Runs**:
   - Use `ListRuns` with status filters to track active workflows
   - Check individual run details with `GetRun` for comprehensive status
   - Monitor tasks with `ListRunTasks` to identify bottlenecks

### Troubleshooting Failed Runs

When workflows fail, follow this diagnostic approach:

1. **Start with DiagnoseRunFailure**: This comprehensive tool provides:
   - Failure reasons and error analysis
   - Failed task identification
   - Log summaries and recommendations
   - Actionable troubleshooting steps

2. **Access Specific Logs**:
   - **Run Logs**: High-level workflow events and status changes
   - **Engine Logs**: Workflow engine STDOUT/STDERR for system-level issues
   - **Task Logs**: Individual task execution details for specific failures
   - **Manifest Logs**: Resource utilization and workflow summary information

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Use `AnalyzeRunPerformance` to identify resource bottlenecks
   - Review task resource utilization patterns
   - Optimize workflow parameters based on analysis results

### Common Use Cases

1. **Workflow Development**:
   ```
   User: "Help me create a new genomic variant calling workflow"
   → Use CreateWorkflow with WDL/CWL/Nextflow definition
   → Package workflow files appropriately
   → Validate syntax and parameters
   ```

2. **Production Execution**:
   ```
   User: "Run my alignment workflow on these FASTQ files"
   → Use StartRun with appropriate parameters
   → Monitor with ListRuns and GetRun
   → Track task progress with ListRunTasks
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   ```
   User: "My workflow failed, what went wrong?"
   → Use DiagnoseRunFailure for comprehensive analysis
   → Access specific logs based on failure type
   → Provide actionable remediation steps
   ```

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   ```
   User: "How can I make my workflow run faster?"
   → Use AnalyzeRunPerformance to identify bottlenecks
   → Review resource utilization patterns
   → Suggest optimization strategies
   ```

### Important Considerations

- **IAM Permissions**: Ensure proper IAM roles with HealthOmics permissions
- **Regional Availability**: Use `GetSupportedRegions` to verify service availability
- **Cost Management**: Monitor storage and compute costs, especially with STATIC storage
- **Data Security**: Follow genomic data handling best practices and compliance requirements
- **Resource Limits**: Be aware of service quotas and limits for concurrent runs

### Error Handling

When tools return errors:
- Check AWS credentials and permissions
- Verify resource IDs (workflow_id, run_id, task_id) are valid
- Ensure proper parameter formatting and required fields
- Use diagnostic tools to understand failure root causes
- Provide clear, actionable error messages to users
