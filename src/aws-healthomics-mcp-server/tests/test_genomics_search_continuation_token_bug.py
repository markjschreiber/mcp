"""Red-first reproduction for the non-advancing continuation_token defect.

``GenomicsSearchOrchestrator.search()`` (the default, non-storage-paginated
path used by ``search_genomics_files`` whenever
``enable_storage_pagination`` is left at its default ``False``) builds
``pagination_info['continuation_token']`` by echoing ``request.continuation_token``
straight back (see ``genomics_search_orchestrator.py`` around line 202,
commented ``# Pass through for now``). It never decodes an incoming
``continuation_token`` to resume from, and it never mints a fresh one from
``next_offset``. An agent that follows the ``paginating()`` wrapper's own
instruction text -- which always says to retry with
``continuation_token="<token>"`` for this tool, per
``utils/pagination.py``'s ``_continuation_param_name`` resolution -- gets
back either the same token it sent (an infinite loop) or ``None`` (a dead
end), and either way never advances past the first page.

No AWS credentials, account, or network access: ``_execute_parallel_searches``
and ``_score_results`` are patched directly, and the real ``result_ranker``,
``association_engine`` and ``json_builder`` run against in-memory fixtures.
